    <p class="coding-caption">This project was based the concept of things being "undefined" mathematically. 
    I was thinking about how electron oribitals work and how they can be understood 
    as a 3D extension of the nodes of oscillating curves. I learned this in a video I watched recently, and 
    I thought this was really interesting. The idea of being so close to something that you feel you <i>should</i> 
    be able to touch it and yet can't is something that's very intriguing to me.</p>
    
    <p class="coding-caption">Of course, the graph of f(x) = tan(x) has undefined points when cos(x) is 0. 
    As you move your mouse more and more, you can see the signs that those aymptotes exist more and more. I made 
    the alpha value as well as the width of the stroke so low so that it would take a fair amount of movement to 
    see it.
    </p>

    <p class="coding-caption">One thing I didn't realize would happen when I started this 
    was that when you move your mouse very quickly, you lose the smooth tangent curves we're used to seeing and 
    instead see scratchy curves, presumably the browser doesn't quite keep up. I thought this added a nice touch 
    the combination of the two, to me at least, looks very nice! I also liked that what would be made by each user 
    would be unique despite the instructions being used to make it being, at least on my end, arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p class="coding-caption">This is the second thing I've made with the p5.js library, and I really like it! I will 
    continue to use this library to make new stuff. Go ahead and make Tangential for yourself!
