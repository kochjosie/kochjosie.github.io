                        <p>Hello! My name is Josephine Koch. I like making art, hobby electronics, creative coding, 
                            writing, and some other stuff too. I have a strong love for iterative problem solving and exploration, 
                            which is an approach I try to bring to everything I do. To quote Dwarf Fortress, "Losing is fun!". 
                            I believe life becomes manageable when you treat it like a series of experiments with the goal of failing 
                            because failing is learning if you're doing it right. While I do believe in a greater purpose to life, I 
                            don't believe this greater purpose is the right way to approach the day. In daily life, you only have means 
                            not ends. These are all ideas I want to address through my projects, writing, and artwork, which you can 
                            find here. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I will add my contact information soon once there's more content here that would justify it :)</p>
