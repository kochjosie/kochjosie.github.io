      <p>Yesterday, I looked at the weather before leaving the apartment. It was 40 degrees. 
        Since I run warm, I figured I didn't need my coat. Unfortunately, it started snowing and 
        was about 15 degrees only an hour or so later. I froze between classes and was mostly just 
        dreading my walk home. There's no funny story here; it was just awful.

        Anyways, the pretty snow did give me an idea for a cute sketch as seen above. 
        The main thing I learned while coding it was using the idea of regions with a 
        defined range function to create a more complex shape. There's definitely more I 
        could learn to make this cooler, but I think this is ok for now. I don't know if 
        there are other resources that help creative coders create paths, so I will want to 
        look into that.
