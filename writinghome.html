			<h2>My Writing</h2>
			<div id="writing-bio">
				<p>Here's my writing! Most of it seems to surround my love of good systems and my hate of signals that people confuse themselves for systems.
				This is not to say I hate signals, just ones that are conflated with the system they're really a proxy for. Signals are tools not truths.
				If you like this idea, you may enjoy what I have linked here! I do not know anything about analytical philosophy nor do I have any kind of formal 
				arts/culture education, so don't expect anything too crazy ;)</p>
