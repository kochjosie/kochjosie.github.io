    <title>Weakness (12/09/25)</title>

	<h1>It’s okay to have weaknesses, even ones that people judge harshly.</h1>
	<h2>Written 12/9/25</h2>
	
	<p class="writing-text">A trend I’ve noticed is a collective inability to understand weaknesses as weaknesses.
	There always seems to be some kind of explanation for how every weakness is a secret strength. 
	I’m not arguing that there aren’t specific strengths that often pair with specific weaknesses. 
	I’m just saying the correlating strength doesn’t make the weakness itself a strength. 
	I’m also saying you shouldn’t think that one requires the other. This is a limiting belief.</p>
	
	<p class="writing-text">For example, people who are more creative than average tend to be more disorganized than average. 
	However, disorganization is not indicative of creativity. Even if it were, it would still be something 
	that makes life more difficult. It’s still a weakness, and one that it’s ok to want to improve without 
	believing it will make you worse at what you want to do.</p>
	
	<p class="writing-text">At the risk of beating a dead horse, I think it’s possible this is related to social media but for a different reason
	than I often hear. I think social media is harmful because it’s not healthy for your personal development to hear people’s 
	opinions on everything all the time. I remember being an 11-year-old around 2012, listening to countless adults on 
	Instagram talk about how embarrassing they themselves were when they were 11. Rather than understand this was something 
	never intended for my ears, I was in the 6th grade and believed that this was an instruction manual for how I could live my 
	life in a way that my 21-year-old self would think my 11-year-old self was actually super cool and awesome. Unfortunately, 
	all this really meant was that I didn’t do things that were healthy and necessary for my development out of fear of judgment 
	from someone who didn’t even exist.</p>
	
	<p class="writing-text">While I was certainly more neurotic than average, I think this trend holds true across the population. 
	People perform for their audience. Rather than have a weakness, like being 11 and childish, it needs to 
	be a part of an easily digested narrative to avoid the painful reaction of judgment. I’m not rude and condescending; 
	I’m just analytical! I’m not self-indulgent and flaky; I’m just a creative! I’m not enabling other people’s self-destruction; 
	I’m an empath!</p>
	
	<p class="writing-text">You’re not in your “Fleabag era”, you have weaknesses, ones that particularly judgmental people would 
	probably love to tear you apart for, even (and often especially) if they loudly claim to be open-minded 
	and accepting. That’s okay. You can improve, but even in the meantime, it’s okay because this is 
	true for all of us. However, I’m also not going to lie to you and tell you that it won’t hurt at 
	first when people judge you. You really just have to get over it and practice not acting in a way 
	oriented around avoiding that specific hurt.</p>
	
	<p class="writing-text">I apologize if this is hard to follow. It’s my first piece of personal writing, and I have a lot to learn (I’m posting it anyway).
