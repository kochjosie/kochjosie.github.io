		<h1>On "On Self-Respect"</h1>
		<p>Written 12/10/25</p>
		
		<p class="writing-text">What I wrote yesterday reminded me of Joan Didion's essay "On Self-Respect" originally published in Vogue in 1961.
		This is one of my favorite pieces of writing. I've noticed, though, that people tend to interpret it in a way I personally disagree with.
		I've seen it described as essentially a slap in the face from reality, which was honestly the opposite of my feeling. I found it incredibly
		empowering, a reminder of the truth that there is a lot of life that is very much in one's control. More importantly, however, I believe that 
		regardless of the degree to which one is victimized by their surroundings (as I do wish to acknowledge that this is not a rarity),
		it is almost always preferable to behave as though one is in full control of their life.
		</p>
		
		<p class="writing-text">"...people with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things."
		</p>
		
		<p class="writing-text">I think about this concept of knowing the "price of things" a lot. I see it as a similar topic to what I wrote 
		yesterday. Understanding that one's weaknesses are just weaknesses and not actually signs of virtue is important to avoid the trap that is over-narrativizing
		one's life. I suppose I was writing more so about the negative aspects of oneself outside of control as I was specifically thinking about diagnoses of mental illness 
		and the importance of understanding that they are indeed disabling and that this is not a secretly good thing. Maybe I didn't stress that point enough, but that's what 
		had inspired me to write it anyway. You need to understand that you have weaknesses and that these weaknesses have a real cost not a secret payday. 
		I feel that once you accept this, it becomes much easier to have self-respect, to see the consequences of your actions not as coincidences but as largely 
		predictable. When you understand the real cost of your innate weaknesses, it's easier to see that there is no reason to continue acting as though your mistakes 
		are meaningless.</p>
		
		<p class="writing-text">The final thing I'd like to add that I think makes this essay so good is that Didion is specifically NOT cruel. She is not 
		picking others apart for their lack of self-respect. She recognizes it as an easy default to fall into in the world we live in and a practice one 
		can cultivate. I think this is an empowering and deeply true message and one I would like to fully internalize.</p>
